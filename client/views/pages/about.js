      answer: "This application exists to trade food debit for cash. With a market capitalization of over $1.3 Million in semesterly debit balances, there is no reason to leave any debit behind at end of the spring semester, after which it is forfeited."

      title: "How is the exchange rate determined?",
      answer: "Supply and demand of food debit determines the rate. Buyers and sellers create orders. When a buy order and sell order can be matched, the transaction occurs instantaneously and the price is reflected on the exchange."
    },
    {
      title: "What happens when a buyer and seller are matched?",
      answer: "The buyer and seller arrange to meet in person. The seller makes purchases at the buyer's discretion and compensates the seller based on the exchange rate at the time of the match."
